## February 2026

### AAP v0.1.0 -- Initial Specification Release

The Agent Alignment Protocol specification is now public. AAP provides post-hoc verification infrastructure for autonomous agents: Alignment Cards declare an agent's alignment posture, AP-Traces create auditable decision records, and Value Coherence Handshakes verify compatibility before multi-agent coordination.

- Full specification with JSON schemas
- Python SDK (`pip install agent-alignment-proto`) and TypeScript SDK (`npm install @mnemom/agent-alignment-protocol`)
- 242 tests (Python), 199 tests (TypeScript), 92 schema validation tests

### AIP v0.1.5 -- Initial Specification with Provider Adapters

The Agent Integrity Protocol specification ships with built-in support for analyzing thinking blocks from multiple LLM providers. AIP provides real-time assurance by analyzing agent reasoning between turns, before actions execute.

- Provider adapters for Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google Gemini
- Conscience prompt system with configurable evaluation criteria
- Session windowing and integrity drift detection
- Python SDK (`pip install agent-integrity-proto`) and TypeScript SDK (`npm install @mnemom/agent-integrity-protocol`)

### Smoltbot v1.0 -- Public Launch

Mnemom's AI gateway and CLI tool for zero-configuration agent transparency infrastructure.

- Cloudflare Workers-based gateway with automatic agent identification
- Observer Worker for AP-Trace generation and AAP verification
- AIP Engine for real-time thinking block analysis
- CLI: `smoltbot init --provider anthropic` for full-stack setup
- API key hashing (never stored in plaintext), raw log deletion within 60 seconds

### aip-otel-exporter v0.1.0 -- OpenTelemetry Integration

OpenTelemetry exporter for AIP and AAP telemetry, enabling agent integrity signals in any OTel-compatible observability platform.

- TypeScript package: `@mnemom/aip-otel-exporter`
- Python package: `aip-otel-exporter`
- GenAI semantic convention span attributes for integrity verdicts, verification results, and drift alerts
- Compatible with Datadog, Grafana, Splunk, Arize, Langfuse, and any OTel collector

### Mnemom Dashboard -- Web Console

The Mnemom Dashboard provides a web interface for managing agents, viewing traces, and monitoring integrity scores.

- Agent management with Alignment Card creation and rotation
- Trace viewer with filtering by session, verdict, and time range
- Integrity score dashboard with real-time and historical drift visualization
- Team management and role-based access control

### Phase 1: Analytics and Intelligence

Enterprise features for organizations deploying agents at scale.

- Enterprise billing with usage-based pricing and license keys
- SSO/SAML authentication via Supabase Auth
- Admin customer detail views and usage analytics
- Daily usage rollup and billing reconciliation
