## Card Lifecycle & Policy Intelligence — CLPI
<sub>February 2026</sub>

**Mnemom becomes a policy-driven governance platform.** A 5-phase overhaul that transforms alignment cards into lifecycle-managed artifacts with policy enforcement, trust recovery, and on-chain anchoring. Root cause: configuration drift (new tools added without updating alignment cards) caused false violations and unfair trust score declines. CLPI fixes this by distinguishing card gaps from behavioral gaps and enabling trust recovery.

### Phase 1: Policy Engine
- **[Policy DSL](/specifications/policy-dsl)**: YAML-based governance rules with `capability_mappings` (glob patterns bridging tools to card categories), `forbidden` rules, `escalation_triggers`, and configurable `defaults`
- **Three evaluation contexts**: CI/CD static validation, gateway live enforcement, observer post-action analysis
- **Enforcement modes**: `warn` (log only), `enforce` (block with 403), `off` — controlled independently from alignment enforcement via `X-Policy-Verdict` header
- **Grace period**: 24-hour default window for newly discovered tools before they become violations
- **[Policy CLI](/smoltbot/policy-cli)**: `smoltbot policy init|validate|publish|list|test|evaluate` subcommands with CI-friendly exit codes
- **Policy merge**: Org-level + agent-level policies merge with union semantics for mappings and floor semantics for defaults

### Phase 2: Card Lifecycle & Trust Recovery
- **[Card amendments](/concepts/card-lifecycle)**: Tracked changes with version history and diffs — cards are now lifecycle-managed artifacts
- **[Violation reclassification](/guides/trust-recovery)**: Distinguish `card_gap` (configuration error) from `behavior_gap` (genuine misbehavior) — reclassified card_gap violations are excluded from compliance and drift scoring
- **Score recomputation**: Automatic trust score recovery after reclassification with trust graph propagation (BFS, depth 3, max 50 agents, 0.85/hop decay)
- **Compliance export**: Full audit trail of violations, reclassifications, card amendments, and score history
- **[Reclassification API](/api-reference/reclassification-overview)**: 5 endpoints for reclassify, recompute, export, and history

### Phase 3: Intelligence Layer
- **[Fault line analysis](/api-reference/intelligence-overview)**: Identify value conflicts and capability gaps across teams with classification (resolvable, priority mismatch, incompatible) and severity scoring
- **Risk forecasting**: Predict failure modes (escalation conflicts, capability gaps, coordination deadlocks, trust erosion) with probability and severity estimates
- **Policy recommendations**: LLM-powered policy generation from team analysis with confidence scores and reasoning chains
- **Transaction guardrails**: 3-layer policy merge (org + team + transaction) with intersection semantics for capability mappings

### Phase 4: On-Chain Verification
- **[ERC-8004 Reputation Registry](/concepts/on-chain-verification)**: Smart contracts on Base L2 for immutable reputation anchoring
- **MnemoReputationRegistry**: Publish individual and batch scores (max 200/batch) with metadata hashes
- **MnemoMerkleAnchor**: Anchor Merkle roots for tamper-evident verification
- **[On-Chain API](/api-reference/on-chain-overview)**: 5 endpoints for anchoring roots, publishing scores, verification, and history

### Phase 5: Observability
- **Policy OTel spans**: `policy.evaluate` span with verdict, violations, and duration attributes
- **Reclassification OTel spans**: `reclassification.process` span with before/after scores and amendment tracking
- **Policy-aware drift detection**: Distinguishes policy gaps from genuine misalignment in drift analysis

## Team Reputation & Risk Scoring (E-25)
<sub>February 2026</sub>

**Teams become first-class meta-agents.** Persistent team identity, team alignment cards, accumulated team reputation with a 5-component scoring model, embeddable team badges, roster management with audit trails, ZK proofs for team reputation, and 9 new webhook events.

- **Team CRUD**: Create, manage, and archive teams of 2-50 agents with persistent identity and organizational scope
- **Team alignment cards**: Auto-derived from member cards (union of values, bounded actions, forbidden actions, escalation triggers) or manually curated — with full version history
- **Team reputation scoring**: 5-component model (coherence history 35%, member quality 25%, operational record 20%, structural stability 10%, assessment density 10%) on the same AAA–NR scale
- **Team badges**: Embeddable SVG badges at `/v1/teams/{id}/badge.svg` with all 4 variants (score, score_tier, score_trend, compact)
- **Roster management**: Add/remove members with full audit trail and roster history endpoint
- **ZK proofs**: Team reputation scores are cryptographically provable via SP1 STARK proofs, chaining individual proof attestations
- **9 webhook events**: `team.created`, `team.archived`, `team.member_added`, `team.member_removed`, `team.card_updated`, `team_reputation.score_changed`, `team_reputation.grade_changed`, `quota.team_reputation_exceeded`, `quota.team_reputation_warning`

## Mnemom Trust Rating -- Public Surfaces & Viral Distribution (E-07)
<sub>February 2026</sub>

**Trust scores escape the dashboard.** Public reputation pages, embeddable badges, a verification endpoint with cryptographic proof chains, an A2A trust extension for inter-agent reputation sharing, a GitHub Action for CI/CD gates, and SDK reputation methods across TypeScript and Python.

- **Public reputation pages**: Every agent with a published score gets a public page at `/agents/{agent_id}/reputation` with full component breakdown, trend chart, and cryptographic verification link
- **Trust Directory**: Searchable directory of all publicly rated agents at `/trust-directory` — filter by grade, confidence, trend, and sort by score or checkpoints
- **Badge ecosystem**: New `score_tier` badge variant displays `[ Mnemom Trust | 782 Established ]`; agents with no reputation record display a "Not Rated" badge instead of a broken image
- **Verification endpoint**: `GET /v1/reputation/{agent_id}/verify` returns a cryptographic proof chain (certificate hash, Merkle root, hash chain validation) for independent score verification
- **A2A trust extension**: `a2a_trust_extension` field added to the reputation response, providing a pre-built trust block for A2A Agent Cards with live score, grade, and verified URLs
- **GitHub Action**: `mnemom/reputation-check@v1` gates CI/CD pipelines on minimum reputation scores — fail builds when agent scores drop below a configurable threshold
- **SDK reputation methods**: TypeScript `getReputation()`, `createReputationGate()`, `getA2AReputationExtension()`; Python `get_reputation()`, `ReputationGate`
- **Webhook events**: `reputation.score_changed` fires when score changes by more than 10 points; `reputation.grade_changed` fires on letter grade transitions

## GPU-Accelerated Proving (Fly.io CPU to Modal H100 GPU)
<sub>February 2026</sub>

**Proving latency reduced from ~270 seconds to ~700ms — a 400x speedup.** Migrated the ZK prover from Fly.io (4-core CPU, SP1 cpu mode) to Modal (NVIDIA H100 GPU, SP1 cuda mode). Per-proof cost dropped from ~$0.005 to ~$0.001 with per-second GPU billing that scales to zero.

- **Infrastructure**: Fly.io performance VMs replaced by Modal serverless H100 GPUs
- **Proving mode**: `SP1_PROVER=cpu` (270s avg) to `SP1_PROVER=cuda` (700ms avg)
- **Benchmarks**: clear 710ms, boundary_violation 721ms, review_needed 690ms (warm GPU: 673ms)
- **Receipt size**: ~2.7 MB (real SP1 STARK proof)
- **Cost**: ~$0.001/proof (Modal H100 at ~$0.001/sec, ~0.7s per proof)
- **Cold start**: 60-120s for SP1 prover initialization; warm requests sub-second
- [Verifiable Verdicts](/protocols/aip/verifiable-verdicts)

## Self-Healing ZK Proof Pipeline
<sub>February 2026</sub>

**Proof inputs are now persisted and the retry loop actually proves.** Three interacting bugs caused the ZK proof pipeline to silently stop generating proofs: Fly.io auto-stopped prover machines despite configuration, the retry loop was a no-op that logged warnings but never called the prover, and the gateway's fire-and-forget pattern lost proof inputs when the prover was unavailable.

- **Proof input persistence**: Gateway now stores `analysis_json`, `thinking_hash`, `card_hash`, `values_hash`, and `model` in `verdict_proofs` on INSERT
- **Self-healing retry loop**: Prover fetches stored inputs from DB and spawns `prove_verdict_derivation()` directly -- no longer depends on the original HTTP request
- **Auto-stop prevention**: Retry loop self-pings `/health` every 30s to maintain HTTP activity; machine-level `autostop=off` set on both prover machines
- **Orphan cleanup**: All pre-fix pending proofs marked as permanently failed (inputs were never persisted)
- **Updated `get_pending_proofs()`**: Returns input columns, filters out rows without stored inputs
- [Verifiable Verdicts -- Proof Input Persistence](/protocols/aip/verifiable-verdicts#proof-input-persistence)

- **Cluster Analysis**: Connected-component grouping of compatible agents with shared/distinguishing values
- **Divergence Report**: Per-value analysis showing which agents declare, miss, or conflict on each value
- **Enterprise API**: `GET /v1/orgs/:org_id/coherence` with 5-minute caching
- **Showcase**: Live interactive fleet coherence panel on [/showcase](https://www.mnemom.ai/showcase)
- **SDK**: `checkFleetCoherence()` in TypeScript and `check_fleet_coherence()` in Python
- **[Fleet Coherence Docs](/concepts/fleet-coherence)**

## Admin Impersonate Mode (E-03)
<sub>February 2026</sub>

**See exactly what your customer sees.** Enterprise support can now view the real dashboard from any customer's perspective -- read-only, fully audit-logged, with automatic 1-hour expiry.

- **Session-based impersonation**: Token-based approach avoids JWT forgery; admin's own JWT stays the auth credential
- **3 API endpoints**: `POST /impersonate` (start), `GET /impersonation/:id` (status), `POST /impersonation/:id/end` (exit)
- **Read-only enforcement**: Centralized write guard rejects all POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE during active session
- **Full audit trail**: Session start/end logged to `admin_audit_log`, per-page visits tracked
- **No nesting**: Cannot impersonate admin users
- **Dashboard integration**: Amber "Viewing as" banner with Exit button, all data resolves to target user
- **Security**: `sessionStorage` (clears on tab close), API keys already masked, payment details already last-4
- [Admin Impersonate Mode guide](/smoltbot/admin-impersonate)

## Custom Conscience Values (E-02)
<sub>February 2026</sub>

**Per-org alignment policies injected into the AIP conscience prompt.** Enterprise orgs can now define custom conscience values -- "patient safety > efficiency" for healthcare, "never recommend regulatory risk" for fintech -- that apply to every agent integrity check.

- **7 API endpoints**: CRUD, reorder, mode control, and audit log under `/v1/orgs/:org_id/conscience-values`
- **Layered value resolution**: Base defaults + org values + per-agent values, with `augment` (additive) and `replace` modes
- **5 value types**: BOUNDARY, FEAR, COMMITMENT, BELIEF, HOPE with advisory/mandatory severity
- **Full audit trail**: Every create, update, delete, and mode change logged with actor and diffs
- **Observer + Gateway integration**: Org values resolved via RPC with 5-min KV cache, fail-open
- **Analyze API integration**: Layered resolution applies to hybrid analysis path
- **Webhook event**: `conscience.values_updated` fires on all mutations
- **Dashboard UI**: Manage values, toggle mode, view audit log from org settings
- **Feature-gated**: Enterprise plan only via `custom_conscience_values` flag
- [Conscience Values guide](/smoltbot/conscience-values)

## Agent Containment Engine
<sub>February 2026</sub>

**Kill-switch for rogue agents.** Enterprise teams can now pause, kill, and resume agents in real-time through the API and dashboard.

- **Containment API**: `POST /pause`, `/resume`, `/kill`, `/reactivate` endpoints under org agent routes
- **Gateway enforcement**: Contained agents receive HTTP 403 with structured `containment_error` response
- **Auto-containment**: Configure automatic pause after N consecutive boundary violations
- **Webhook events**: `agent.paused`, `agent.resumed`, `agent.killed` events for SIEM integration
- **Audit log**: Every containment action recorded with actor, reason, and state transition
- **RBAC**: Kill/reactivate restricted to owners; pause/resume available to admins

## February 2026

### Phase 12: Verifiable Integrity -- Cryptographic Proof Layer

Every AIP verdict can now be independently verified through a four-layer cryptographic attestation stack. Agents produce IntegrityCertificates that bundle Ed25519 signatures, hash chain proofs, Merkle inclusion proofs, and optional SP1 zero-knowledge proofs into a single portable artifact.

- **Ed25519 checkpoint signing** with key rotation and public key registry
- **Hash chain integrity** linking consecutive verdicts into a tamper-evident sequence
- **Merkle tree certificates** enabling compact inclusion proofs for any checkpoint
- **Zero-knowledge proofs** (SP1 STARK) for verdict derivation verification
- 7 new verification API endpoints (`/v1/verify`, `/v1/keys`, certificate, proof, and Merkle endpoints)
- Client-side WASM verifier for offline, trustless verification
- Optimistic proving strategy: 10% stochastic + all boundary violations
