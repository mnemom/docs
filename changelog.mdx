## N-Way Fleet Coherence (E-05)
<sub>February 2026</sub>

**Fleet-level value coherence analysis** — extend pairwise coherence checks to true N-agent fleet analysis with aggregate scoring, outlier detection, cluster analysis, and divergence reporting.

- **Fleet Score**: Mean of all C(n,2) pairwise coherence scores with weakest-link identification
- **Outlier Detection**: Statistical detection of agents >1σ below fleet mean, with primary conflict identification
- **Cluster Analysis**: Connected-component grouping of compatible agents with shared/distinguishing values
- **Divergence Report**: Per-value analysis showing which agents declare, miss, or conflict on each value
- **Enterprise API**: `GET /v1/orgs/:org_id/coherence` with 5-minute caching
- **Showcase**: Live interactive fleet coherence panel on [/showcase](/showcase)
- **SDK**: `checkFleetCoherence()` in TypeScript and `check_fleet_coherence()` in Python
- **[Fleet Coherence Docs](/concepts/fleet-coherence)**

## Admin Impersonate Mode (E-03)
<sub>February 2026</sub>

**See exactly what your customer sees.** Enterprise support can now view the real dashboard from any customer's perspective -- read-only, fully audit-logged, with automatic 1-hour expiry.

- **Session-based impersonation**: Token-based approach avoids JWT forgery; admin's own JWT stays the auth credential
- **3 API endpoints**: `POST /impersonate` (start), `GET /impersonation/:id` (status), `POST /impersonation/:id/end` (exit)
- **Read-only enforcement**: Centralized write guard rejects all POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE during active session
- **Full audit trail**: Session start/end logged to `admin_audit_log`, per-page visits tracked
- **No nesting**: Cannot impersonate admin users
- **Dashboard integration**: Amber "Viewing as" banner with Exit button, all data resolves to target user
- **Security**: `sessionStorage` (clears on tab close), API keys already masked, payment details already last-4
- [Admin Impersonate Mode guide](/smoltbot/admin-impersonate)

## Custom Conscience Values (E-02)
<sub>February 2026</sub>

**Per-org alignment policies injected into the AIP conscience prompt.** Enterprise orgs can now define custom conscience values -- "patient safety > efficiency" for healthcare, "never recommend regulatory risk" for fintech -- that apply to every agent integrity check.

- **7 API endpoints**: CRUD, reorder, mode control, and audit log under `/v1/orgs/:org_id/conscience-values`
- **Layered value resolution**: Base defaults + org values + per-agent values, with `augment` (additive) and `replace` modes
- **5 value types**: BOUNDARY, FEAR, COMMITMENT, BELIEF, HOPE with advisory/mandatory severity
- **Full audit trail**: Every create, update, delete, and mode change logged with actor and diffs
- **Observer + Gateway integration**: Org values resolved via RPC with 5-min KV cache, fail-open
- **Analyze API integration**: Layered resolution applies to hybrid analysis path
- **Webhook event**: `conscience.values_updated` fires on all mutations
- **Dashboard UI**: Manage values, toggle mode, view audit log from org settings
- **Feature-gated**: Enterprise plan only via `custom_conscience_values` flag
- [Conscience Values guide](/smoltbot/conscience-values)

## Agent Containment Engine
<sub>February 2026</sub>

**Kill-switch for rogue agents.** Enterprise teams can now pause, kill, and resume agents in real-time through the API and dashboard.

- **Containment API**: `POST /pause`, `/resume`, `/kill`, `/reactivate` endpoints under org agent routes
- **Gateway enforcement**: Contained agents receive HTTP 403 with structured `containment_error` response
- **Auto-containment**: Configure automatic pause after N consecutive boundary violations
- **Webhook events**: `agent.paused`, `agent.resumed`, `agent.killed` events for SIEM integration
- **Audit log**: Every containment action recorded with actor, reason, and state transition
- **RBAC**: Kill/reactivate restricted to owners; pause/resume available to admins

## February 2026

### Phase 12: Verifiable Integrity -- Cryptographic Proof Layer

Every AIP verdict can now be independently verified through a four-layer cryptographic attestation stack. Agents produce IntegrityCertificates that bundle Ed25519 signatures, hash chain proofs, Merkle inclusion proofs, and optional RISC Zero zero-knowledge proofs into a single portable artifact.

- **Ed25519 checkpoint signing** with key rotation and public key registry
- **Hash chain integrity** linking consecutive verdicts into a tamper-evident sequence
- **Merkle tree certificates** enabling compact inclusion proofs for any checkpoint
- **Zero-knowledge proofs** (RISC Zero STARK) for verdict derivation verification
- 7 new verification API endpoints (`/v1/verify`, `/v1/keys`, certificate, proof, and Merkle endpoints)
- Client-side WASM verifier for offline, trustless verification
- Optimistic proving strategy: 10% stochastic + all boundary violations
- [Certificates specification](/protocols/aip/certificates)
- [Verifiable Verdicts specification](/protocols/aip/verifiable-verdicts)

### AAP v0.1.0 -- Initial Specification Release

The Agent Alignment Protocol specification is now public. AAP provides post-hoc verification infrastructure for autonomous agents: Alignment Cards declare an agent's alignment posture, AP-Traces create auditable decision records, and Value Coherence Handshakes verify compatibility before multi-agent coordination.

- Full specification with JSON schemas
- Python SDK (`pip install agent-alignment-proto`) and TypeScript SDK (`npm install @mnemom/agent-alignment-protocol`)
- 242 tests (Python), 199 tests (TypeScript), 92 schema validation tests

### AIP v0.1.5 -- Initial Specification with Provider Adapters

The Agent Integrity Protocol specification ships with built-in support for analyzing thinking blocks from multiple LLM providers. AIP provides real-time assurance by analyzing agent reasoning between turns, before actions execute.

- Provider adapters for Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google Gemini
- Conscience prompt system with configurable evaluation criteria
- Session windowing and integrity drift detection
- Python SDK (`pip install agent-integrity-proto`) and TypeScript SDK (`npm install @mnemom/agent-integrity-protocol`)

### Smoltbot v1.0 -- Public Launch

Mnemom's AI gateway and CLI tool for zero-configuration agent transparency infrastructure.

- Cloudflare Workers-based gateway with automatic agent identification
- Observer Worker for AP-Trace generation and AAP verification
- AIP Engine for real-time thinking block analysis
- CLI: `smoltbot init --provider anthropic` for full-stack setup
- API key hashing (never stored in plaintext), raw log deletion within 60 seconds

### aip-otel-exporter v0.1.0 -- OpenTelemetry Integration

OpenTelemetry exporter for AIP and AAP telemetry, enabling agent integrity signals in any OTel-compatible observability platform.

- TypeScript package: `@mnemom/aip-otel-exporter`
- Python package: `aip-otel-exporter`
- GenAI semantic convention span attributes for integrity verdicts, verification results, and drift alerts
- Compatible with Datadog, Grafana, Splunk, Arize, Langfuse, and any OTel collector

### Mnemom Dashboard -- Web Console

The Mnemom Dashboard provides a web interface for managing agents, viewing traces, and monitoring integrity scores.

- Agent management with Alignment Card creation and rotation
- Trace viewer with filtering by session, verdict, and time range
- Integrity score dashboard with real-time and historical drift visualization
- Team management and role-based access control

### Phase 1: Analytics and Intelligence

Enterprise features for organizations deploying agents at scale.

- Enterprise billing with usage-based pricing and license keys
- SSO/SAML authentication via Supabase Auth
- Admin customer detail views and usage analytics
- Daily usage rollup and billing reconciliation
