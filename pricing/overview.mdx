## Open Source

<Note>
The AAP and AIP protocols are open source (Apache 2.0). You only pay for Mnemom's managed infrastructure — the gateway, API, dashboard, and hosted analysis.
</Note>

You can self-host the protocol SDKs, build your own verification pipeline, and run your own analysis engine. Mnemom's commercial offering provides the managed infrastructure layer: hosted gateway, trace storage, dashboards, compliance features, and the analysis API.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How does usage-based billing work?">
    The Developer plan charges $0.01 per integrity check with no monthly minimum. The Team plan includes 15,000 checks per month, with overages billed at $0.008/check. You only pay for what you use.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What counts as a 'check'?">
    A check is a single integrity or alignment verification — one call to the analysis API. This includes AIP integrity checkpoints (real-time thinking block analysis) and AAP trace verifications (post-hoc alignment checks). Each API call that produces a verdict counts as one check.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is there a free trial?">
    The Team plan includes a 14-day free trial with full access to all features and 15,000 included checks. No credit card required to start. Add a payment method before the trial ends to continue.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I cancel anytime?">
    Yes. Cancellations take effect at the end of your current billing period. Your data (agents, traces, alignment cards) is fully preserved — you can resubscribe anytime to restore access.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do you offer enterprise pricing?">
    Enterprise plans are custom-quoted based on volume, support needs, and deployment preferences. Contact us for a tailored proposal including custom SLAs and dedicated support. SSO/SAML is included with Enterprise plans, and self-hosted deployment is on our near-term roadmap.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Are the protocols free to use?">
    Yes. The Agent Integrity Protocol (AIP) and Agent Alignment Protocol (AAP) are fully open source under Apache 2.0. Mnemom's commercial offering is the managed infrastructure: hosted gateway, trace storage, dashboards, and compliance features.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What's your data retention policy?">
    Developer plans retain traces for 30 days. Team plans retain traces for 90 days. Enterprise plans offer custom retention periods. All data is encrypted at rest.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do you support promo codes?">
    Yes! Enter your promo code during checkout to apply a discount. Promo codes can be applied to both Developer and Team plans.
