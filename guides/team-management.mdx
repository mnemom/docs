# Team Management

**Teams are first-class meta-agents in Mnemom.** Create a team, add agents, derive a collective alignment card, and monitor team reputation — all through the API or dashboard.

This guide covers the full team lifecycle: creation, roster management, alignment cards, reputation monitoring, and team badges.

<Info>
Team operations require the `team_reputation` feature flag, available on Team and Enterprise plans. See [Pricing](/pricing/overview) for details.

## Quick Start

Create a team, add members, and derive a card in three API calls:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
import { createTeam, deriveTeamCard } from '@mnemom/teams';

// 1. Create a team with initial members
const team = await createTeam({
  org_id: 'org-abc123',
  name: 'Support Pipeline Alpha',
  description: 'Customer support agent team',
  agent_ids: ['agent-a', 'agent-b', 'agent-c'],
});

console.log(`Team created: ${team.team.id}`);
console.log(`Members: ${team.members.length}`);

// 2. Derive a team alignment card from member cards
const derived = await deriveTeamCard(team.team.id);
console.log(`Card derived from ${derived.members_with_cards} members`);
console.log(`Card source: ${derived.card_source}`);
```

```python Python
import httpx

API_BASE = "https://api.mnemom.ai"
HEADERS = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}", "Content-Type": "application/json"}

# 1. Create a team with initial members
response = httpx.post(f"{API_BASE}/v1/teams", headers=HEADERS, json={
    "org_id": "org-abc123",
    "name": "Support Pipeline Alpha",
    "description": "Customer support agent team",
    "agent_ids": ["agent-a", "agent-b", "agent-c"],
})
team = response.json()
team_id = team["team"]["id"]
print(f"Team created: {team_id}")

# 2. Derive a team alignment card from member cards
card = httpx.post(f"{API_BASE}/v1/teams/{team_id}/card/derive", headers=HEADERS)
print(f"Card derived from {card.json()['members_with_cards']} members")
```
</CodeGroup>

## Team Lifecycle

```
Create → Add Members → Derive Card → Monitor Reputation → Archive
  │          │              │               │                 │
  ▼          ▼              ▼               ▼                 ▼
POST      POST           POST           GET              DELETE
/teams    /members       /card/derive   /reputation      /teams/{id}
```

### 1. Create a Team

Teams require an organization, a name, and at least 2 initial members (max 50).

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.mnemom.ai/v1/teams \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "org_id": "org-abc123",
    "name": "Support Pipeline Alpha",
    "description": "Customer support agent team",
    "agent_ids": ["agent-a", "agent-b", "agent-c"],
    "metadata": { "environment": "production", "domain": "support" }
  }'
```

Team names must be unique within an organization. The response includes the team object and the initial member list.

### 2. Manage Roster

Add or remove members as your team evolves. Every roster change is logged in the audit trail.

**Add members:**

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.mnemom.ai/v1/teams/{team_id}/members \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "agent_ids": ["agent-d", "agent-e"] }'
```

The response tells you which agents were added and which were already members (idempotent).

**Remove a member:**

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://api.mnemom.ai/v1/teams/{team_id}/members/{agent_id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

<Warning>
Teams must have at least 2 members. Removing the second-to-last member will fail with a 400 error. Archive the team instead if it's no longer needed.
</Warning>

**View roster history:**

```bash
curl https://api.mnemom.ai/v1/teams/{team_id}/roster-history \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

Returns a paginated audit trail of all roster changes with timestamps, change types, and actors.

### 3. Team Alignment Cards

Team alignment cards declare the team's collective values, autonomy boundaries, and coordination mode. There are two approaches:

**Auto-derive from members** (recommended):

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.mnemom.ai/v1/teams/{team_id}/card/derive \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

The derivation algorithm merges member cards:
- Values are unioned and ordered by frequency
- Forbidden actions from any member apply to the team
- The strictest audit retention policy wins
- Requires at least 2 members with active alignment cards

**Set manually:**

```bash
curl -X PUT https://api.mnemom.ai/v1/teams/{team_id}/card \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "principal": {
      "type": "organization",
      "identifier": "org-abc123",
      "relationship": "delegated_authority"
    },
    "values": {
      "declared": ["reliability", "transparency", "user_safety"]
    },
    "autonomy_envelope": {
      "bounded_actions": ["respond_to_customer", "escalate_ticket"],
      "forbidden_actions": ["delete_customer_data", "modify_billing"],
      "escalation_triggers": ["customer_complaint", "refund_request_over_100"]
    },
    "audit_commitment": {
      "retention_days": 90
    }
  }'
```

**View card history:**

```bash
curl https://api.mnemom.ai/v1/teams/{team_id}/card/history \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

### 4. Monitor Reputation

Once your team has 10+ risk assessments, a Team Trust Rating is published.

```bash
curl https://api.mnemom.ai/v1/teams/{team_id}/reputation
```

Track score trends over time:

```bash
curl https://api.mnemom.ai/v1/teams/{team_id}/reputation/history
```

See [Team Trust Rating](/concepts/team-reputation) for details on the 5-component scoring model.

### 5. Archive a Team

Archiving soft-deletes the team. Historical data and reputation scores are preserved.

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://api.mnemom.ai/v1/teams/{team_id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

## Team Badges

Embed team reputation badges anywhere — READMEs, documentation, dashboards.

```
GET https://api.mnemom.ai/v1/teams/{team_id}/badge.svg?variant={variant}
```

Six badge variants are available:

| Variant | Display |
|---------|---------|
| `score` | `[ Team Trust \| 812 ]` |
| `grade` | `[ Team Trust \| AA ]` |
| `score_grade` | `[ Team Trust \| AA 812 ]` |
| `score_trend` | `[ Team Trust \| AA 812 ↑ ]` |
| `score_tier` | `[ Mnemom Team \| 812 Established ]` |
| `compact` | `[ AA ]` |

Pre-eligible teams (fewer than 10 assessments) show a progress badge:

```
[ Team Trust | Building 4/10 ]
```

**Markdown embed:**

```markdown
[![Team Trust Rating](https://api.mnemom.ai/v1/teams/team-abc123/badge.svg?variant=score)](https://www.mnemom.ai/teams/team-abc123/reputation)
```

**HTML embed:**

```html
<a href="https://www.mnemom.ai/teams/team-abc123/reputation">
  <img src="https://api.mnemom.ai/v1/teams/team-abc123/badge.svg?variant=score"
       alt="Team Trust Rating" />
</a>
```

**React:**

```jsx
function TeamBadge({ teamId }) {
  const badgeUrl = `https://api.mnemom.ai/v1/teams/${teamId}/badge.svg?variant=score`;
  const pageUrl = `https://www.mnemom.ai/teams/${teamId}/reputation`;

  return (
    <a href={pageUrl} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      <img src={badgeUrl} alt="Team Trust Rating" />
    </a>
  );
}
```

Badges are cached for 60 minutes at the CDN edge. For real-time data, use the API directly.
