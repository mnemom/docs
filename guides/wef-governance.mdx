# WEF Agent Governance Framework

## How AAP Operationalizes the World Economic Forum's Agent Governance Framework

In November 2025, the World Economic Forum and Capgemini published *AI Agents in Action: Foundations for Evaluation and Governance*, introducing a structured framework for classifying, evaluating, assessing risk, and governing AI agents. The report's central artifact is the **agent card** — a structured description of an agent's capabilities, behavior, and operational context, inspired by Model Cards for Model Reporting (Mitchell et al., 2019). The report proposes seven classification dimensions, a multi-metric evaluation methodology, a five-step risk assessment lifecycle, nine baseline governance mechanisms, and a progressive governance model that scales oversight with agent capability.

The Agent Alignment Protocol (AAP) and Agent Integrity Protocol (AIP) implement what the WEF report recommends. AAP's **Alignment Card** is a machine-readable, protocol-level artifact that maps to all seven WEF classification dimensions and extends them with enforceable behavioral contracts, auditable decision trails, and multi-agent compatibility verification. AIP provides the continuous monitoring infrastructure the WEF calls for at every governance level.

<Note>
**Key distinction**: The WEF agent card *describes* an agent. The AAP Alignment Card *binds* it. The WEF tells organizations what to ask about their agents. AAP provides the machine-readable, verifiable answers. AIP provides the continuous assurance that those answers remain true at runtime.
</Note>

## 1. The WEF Framework Architecture

The WEF report structures responsible agent deployment around three major sections and four foundational pillars.

### 1.1 Report Structure

| WEF Section | Content | AAP/AIP Relevance |
|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| **Section 1: Technical Foundations** | 3-layer agent architecture (Application, Orchestration, Reasoning), protocols (MCP, A2A, AP2), cybersecurity | AAP extends A2A agent cards; AIP addresses prompt injection and zero-trust |
| **Section 2: Evaluation and Governance** | Classification dimensions, evaluation criteria, risk assessment lifecycle, progressive governance | Alignment Card (classification), AP-Traces (evaluation), violation typing (risk), autonomy envelope (governance) |
| **Section 3: Multi-Agent Ecosystems** | Emerging risks, failure modes, governor agents, trust frameworks | Value Coherence Handshake, Braid grounding, AIP daimonion |

### 1.2 Four Foundational Pillars

| Pillar | WEF Purpose | AAP/AIP Implementation |
|--------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Classification** | Establish agent characteristics and operational context | Alignment Card — JSON-schema-validated, well-known endpoint, versionable, expirable |
| **Evaluation** | Generate evidence of performance and limitations | AP-Trace verification, AIP Integrity Checkpoints, drift detection |
| **Risk Assessment** | Analyse potential harm using classification and evaluation | Typed violation severities (`FORBIDDEN_ACTION` through `CARD_MISMATCH`), concern categories |
| **Progressive Governance** | Scale oversight proportionally to capability and context | Autonomy envelope + `principal.relationship` + AIP monitoring intensity + fail-open/fail-closed |

### 1.3 Provider vs. Adopter Perspectives

The WEF report distinguishes two stakeholder perspectives that shape how the framework is applied. AAP addresses both:

| WEF Perspective | WEF Responsibility | AAP/AIP Role |
|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Provider** | Build responsibly, supply documentation, ensure ethical guidelines | The Alignment Card *is* the provider's documentation artifact — structured, versioned, served at `/.well-known/alignment-card.json` |
| **Adopter** | Procure responsibly, deploy safely, ensure organizational compliance | AP-Trace verification and AIP monitoring give adopters independent assurance that provider claims hold in production |

## 2. Classification: Dimension-by-Dimension Mapping

The WEF's classification pillar introduces seven dimensions, organized into **Agent Characteristics** (dimensions 1-5) and **Operational Context** (dimensions 6-7). The agent card is the primary artifact.

### 2.1 Function

**WEF definition**: What task is the agent designed to perform?

The Alignment Card's `bounded_actions` array declares the agent's permitted functions as an explicit, machine-parseable list. Where the WEF asks organizations to describe function in natural language, AAP requires it as structured data that can be verified against observed behavior.

| WEF Concept | AAP Field | Type |
|-------------|-----------|------|
| Agent function/task | `autonomy_envelope.bounded_actions` | String array |
| Function constraints | `autonomy_envelope.forbidden_actions` | String array |

The WEF describes function; AAP also describes *anti-function* — what the agent must never do, regardless of context. The `forbidden_actions` field has no WEF equivalent. A violation of `forbidden_actions` generates a `FORBIDDEN_ACTION` violation at `CRITICAL` severity.

### 2.2 Role

**WEF definition**: Is the agent specialized (narrow task) or generalist (broad capabilities)?

| WEF Concept | AAP Field | Values |
|-------------|-----------|--------|
| Specialist vs. generalist | `bounded_actions` array length | Narrow (few actions) vs. broad (many) |
| Operational role | `principal.relationship` | `delegated_authority`, `advisory`, `autonomous` |

The WEF's role dimension is descriptive. AAP's `principal.relationship` field is *prescriptive* — it determines how the agent should behave when it encounters uncertainty. An `advisory` agent recommends and waits. A `delegated_authority` agent acts within bounds. An `autonomous` agent operates within declared values.

### 2.3 Predictability

**WEF definition**: Is the agent deterministic or non-deterministic?

The WEF explicitly identifies "behavioural drift" as a novel risk that traditional governance cannot manage.

| WEF Concept | AAP/AIP Field | Function |
|-------------|---------------|----------|
| Behavioral predictability | `audit_commitment.trace_format` | Structured logging of non-deterministic decisions |
| Non-deterministic monitoring | AIP Integrity Checkpoints | Real-time analysis of thinking blocks between turns |
| Behavioral change over time | AIP `IntegrityDriftAlert` | Cross-session behavioral divergence detection |
| Tamper evidence | `audit_commitment.tamper_evidence` | `append_only`, `signed`, or `merkle` trail integrity |

AAP and AIP assume non-determinism is the default and provide infrastructure to *observe* it. The question shifts from "is it predictable?" to "is its unpredictability observable and characterized?"

### 2.4 Autonomy

**WEF definition**: The degree of independent planning, decision-making, and action.

This is the most direct mapping. AAP's autonomy envelope is a formal, machine-readable specification of exactly what the WEF means by "autonomy level."

| WEF Concept | AAP Field | Function |
|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Autonomy level | `autonomy_envelope` (composite) | Complete autonomy specification |
| What agent can do independently | `autonomy_envelope.bounded_actions` | Permitted autonomous actions |
| When agent must stop and ask | `autonomy_envelope.escalation_triggers` | Condition-based escalation rules |
| Financial limits on autonomy | `autonomy_envelope.max_autonomous_value` | Currency-denominated ceiling |
| Who to escalate to | `principal.escalation_contact` | Endpoint for escalation notifications |
| Real-time calibration | AIP `recommended_action` | `continue`, `log_and_continue`, `pause_for_review`, `deny_and_escalate` |

### 2.5 Authority

**WEF definition**: The actions an agent is permitted to take, from read-only access to full administrative control.

| WEF Concept | AAP Field | Function |
|-------------|-----------|----------|
| System permissions | `autonomy_envelope.bounded_actions` | What the agent is permitted to do |
| Permission boundaries | `autonomy_envelope.forbidden_actions` | Hard limits regardless of context |
| Data access scope | `autonomy_envelope.escalation_triggers` | Conditions that constrain data access |
| Delegation chain | `principal.type` + `principal.relationship` | Who delegated authority and how |
| Permission expiry | `expires_at` | Authority has a time limit |
| Authority verification | `verify_trace` returns `UNBOUNDED_ACTION` | Detects actions outside granted authority |

AAP adds verifiable delegation chains. When `principal.type` is `"agent"`, the card records that authority was delegated from another agent, enabling accountability tracing through multi-agent workflows.

### 2.6 Use Case

**WEF definition**: The specific application domain and environment where the agent performs its function.

| WEF Concept | AAP Field | Function |
|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Application domain | `values.declared` | Domain-specific values |
| Domain constraints | `values.conflicts_with` | Values the agent explicitly rejects |
| Value definitions | `values.definitions` | Maps each value ID to `name`, `description`, `priority` |
| Value hierarchy | `values.hierarchy` | `lexicographic`, `weighted`, or `contextual` resolution |
| Domain-specific extensions | `extensions` | Protocol-specific or domain-specific metadata |

### 2.7 Environment

**WEF definition**: Operational environment complexity — simple, complex, or multi-system.

| WEF Concept | AAP Field | Function |
|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Single-system vs. multi-system | A2A Agent Card `alignment` block | AAP extends A2A for cross-system use |
| External system interactions | `/.well-known/alignment-card.json` | Discoverable card for any system to retrieve |
| Zero-trust assumptions | AIP fail-closed mode | Block agent on analysis failure in high-security environments |
| Cross-agent coordination | Value Coherence Handshake | Pre-coordination compatibility check |
| Environment observability | AIP `window_summary` | Rolling integrity statistics |

## 3. Evaluation: Metrics and Evidence

The WEF's Evaluation pillar establishes four evaluation principles and specific performance metrics.

### 3.1 Evaluation Principles

| WEF Evaluation Principle | WEF Description | AAP/AIP Implementation |
|--------------------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| **Contextualization** | Reflect the tools, workflows, and edge cases the agent will encounter | AP-Traces record `context` for each decision — actual operational conditions |
| **Multidimensional assessment** | Define success across accuracy, robustness, latency, compliance, trust | `verify_trace` produces multi-dimensional results: violation counts by type and severity |
| **Temporal and behavioural monitoring** | Track performance over time to detect regressions | AIP `IntegrityDriftAlert` with `integrity_similarity` ratio and `sustained_checks` count |
| **Provider-deployer collaboration** | Transparent documentation enables deployers to validate reliability | Alignment Card at `/.well-known/` *is* the transparent documentation |

### 3.2 Evaluation Metrics

| WEF Metric | AAP/AIP Evidence Source |
|------------|------------------------|
| **Task success rate** | AP-Trace `verify_trace` — ratio of traces with zero violations to total traces |
| **Task completion time** | AP-Trace timestamps enable latency analysis |
| **Error types** | Typed violations: `FORBIDDEN_ACTION`, `UNBOUNDED_ACTION`, `MISSED_ESCALATION`, `UNDECLARED_VALUE`, `CARD_EXPIRED`, `CARD_MISMATCH` |
| **Tool call success** | AP-Trace `action` field logs tool invocations; verification flags `UNBOUNDED_ACTION` for unauthorized tool use |
| **Edge case robustness** | AIP concern categories — `reasoning_corruption` and `autonomy_violation` surface edge case failures |
| **Trust indicators** | AIP `integrity_ratio` — a quantitative trust metric |
| **Capabilities** | Alignment Card `bounded_actions` declares capabilities; AP-Traces verify they match observed behavior |

### 3.3 Audit Logs

| WEF Audit Requirement | AAP Field | Implementation |
|----------------------|-----------|----------------|
| Structured records | `audit_commitment.trace_format` | `"ap-trace-v1"` — standardized, schema-validated |
| Retention policy | `audit_commitment.retention_days` | Explicit retention period |
| Queryable logs | `audit_commitment.queryable` + `query_endpoint` | API-accessible trace history |
| Tamper resistance | `audit_commitment.tamper_evidence` | `append_only`, `signed`, or `merkle` |
| Rationale capture | AP-Trace `alternatives_considered` + `selection_reasoning` | Why the agent chose what it chose |

## 4. Risk Assessment: Lifecycle Mapping

The WEF's Risk Assessment pillar proposes a five-step lifecycle. AAP/AIP provides tooling at each step:

| WEF Step | WEF Objective | AAP/AIP Tooling |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **1. Define context** | Establish scope, boundaries, criteria | Alignment Card defines identity, values, autonomy bounds |
| **2. Identify risks** | Identify potential risks | `forbidden_actions` pre-declares known risks; `values.conflicts_with` declares value-level risks |
| **3. Analyse risks** | Assess probability and impact | `verify_trace` produces violation counts by type and severity; AIP surfaces `drift_direction` |
| **4. Evaluate risks** | Rank and prioritize risks | AAP violation severities (`CRITICAL`, `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`) provide built-in risk ranking |
| **5. Manage risks** | Implement response actions | AIP `recommended_action` implements graduated response |

### 4.1 Violation Severity as Risk Taxonomy

| Violation Type | Severity | WEF Risk Category | WEF Governance Area |
|----------------|----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| `FORBIDDEN_ACTION` | CRITICAL | Authority violation, safety hazard | Access control |
| `CARD_MISMATCH` | CRITICAL | Identity/integrity failure | Traceability and identity |
| `UNBOUNDED_ACTION` | HIGH | Autonomy overreach | Access control, Human oversight |
| `MISSED_ESCALATION` | HIGH | Governance failure | Human oversight |
| `CARD_EXPIRED` | HIGH | Lifecycle management failure | Long-term management |
| `UNDECLARED_VALUE` | MEDIUM | Value misalignment | Trustworthiness and explainability |

## 5. Progressive Governance: Mechanisms Mapping

The WEF's Progressive Governance pillar proposes that governance scales with agent capability. It identifies nine baseline governance mechanisms and two human oversight models (HITL/HOTL).

### 5.1 Human Oversight Models

| WEF Model | WEF Definition | AAP Field | AAP Behavior |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|--------------|
| **HITL** (Human-in-the-loop) | Agent suggests or prepares actions; final decisions require explicit human approval | `principal.relationship: "advisory"` | Agent recommends and waits; escalation is the default |
| **HOTL** (Human-on-the-loop) | Agent acts within defined boundaries; humans monitor and retain ability to intervene | `principal.relationship: "delegated_authority"` | Agent acts within `bounded_actions`; escalation on trigger conditions |
| *(Implied high-autonomy)* | Agent operates independently within declared value framework | `principal.relationship: "autonomous"` | Agent operates within values; AIP heightened monitoring |

AIP implements progressive monitoring intensity based on this mapping: `advisory` agents receive standard monitoring, `delegated_authority` agents receive standard monitoring with escalation enforcement, and `autonomous` agents receive heightened monitoring with deeper conscience evaluation.

### 5.2 Baseline Governance Mechanisms

| WEF Governance Area | WEF Mechanism | AAP/AIP Implementation |
|---------------------|---------------|------------------------|
| **Access control** | Enforce least-privilege access; define task boundaries | `bounded_actions` (permitted), `forbidden_actions` (denied), `max_autonomous_value` (financial ceiling) |
| **Legal and compliance** | Data protection impact assessments; privacy and regulation compliance | `values.declared` encodes compliance values; `extensions` namespace for regulatory metadata; `audit_commitment` enables DPIA evidence |
| **Testing and validation** | Sandbox runs, controlled pilots, third-party audits | `verify_trace` against Alignment Card is the validation engine; AIP input analysis acts as input filter |
| **Monitoring and logging** | Logging for all agent actions; anomaly alerts and dashboards | AP-Traces, AIP Integrity Checkpoints, `IntegrityDriftAlert`, OTel export via [aip-otel-exporter](/guides/observability) |
| **Human oversight** | Define HITL/HOTL models; set supervisory triggers | `principal.relationship`, `escalation_triggers`, `principal.escalation_contact` |
| **Traceability and identity** | Assign unique agent identifiers; tag outputs to responsible agent | `card_id` + `agent_id`, AP-Trace entries linked to `card_id`, AIP checkpoints linked to `agent_id` + `session_id` |
| **Long-term management** | Protocols for ongoing monitoring, updates, decommissioning | `expires_at` (card expiry enforces lifecycle review), `CARD_EXPIRED` violation triggers re-evaluation |
| **Trustworthiness and explainability** | Explainability tools; trust metrics | AIP `reasoning_summary`, AP-Trace `alternatives_considered` + `selection_reasoning`, AIP `integrity_ratio` |
| **Manual redundancy** | Procedures for human takeover of critical cases | `escalation_triggers`, `principal.escalation_contact`, AIP `recommended_action: "deny_and_escalate"` |

## 6. Technical Foundations: Protocol Alignment

### 6.1 Communication Protocols

| WEF Protocol | AAP/AIP Relationship |
|-------------|---------------------|
| **MCP** | AAP `extensions` namespace supports MCP-specific metadata |
| **A2A** | AAP extends A2A Agent Cards with the `alignment` block |
| **AP2** | AAP's `max_autonomous_value` maps to AP2's auditable transaction limits |
| **Agent Cards (A2A)** | AAP Alignment Card is the A2A agent card *plus* enforceable alignment posture |

### 6.2 Cybersecurity

| WEF Security Concern | AIP Implementation |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| Prompt injection | AIP concern category: `prompt_injection` — dedicated detection in every Integrity Checkpoint |
| Agent misuse | AIP concern category: `deceptive_reasoning` + `undeclared_intent` |
| Zero-trust model | AIP `FailurePolicy.mode: "fail_closed"` — blocks agent on any analysis failure |
| Audit trails for attribution | AP-Traces + Integrity Checkpoints provide complete forensic record |
| Identity verification | `/.well-known/alignment-card.json` enables any party to verify agent identity |

## 7. Multi-Agent Ecosystem Risks

The WEF identifies five emerging failure modes in multi-agent ecosystems. AAP/AIP addresses all five:

| WEF Risk | AAP/AIP Solution |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Orchestration drift** | **Value Coherence Handshake**: Before coordination, agents exchange Alignment Cards and compute compatibility score. If `coherence.compatible` is false, coordination pauses. |
| **Semantic misalignment** | **Braid grounding protocol**: Agents detect semantic divergence via SSM analysis. `values.conflicts_with` pre-declares known semantic conflicts. |
| **Security and trust gaps** | **Well-known endpoint discovery** (zero-trust), AIP `prompt_injection` concern category, AIP fail-closed mode. |
| **Interconnectedness and cascading effects** | **AIP `IntegrityDriftAlert`** with `drift_direction` typing enables early detection. `CARD_MISMATCH` immediately flags identity inconsistencies. |
| **Systemic complexity** | **AP-Traces** with `linked_trace_id` enable cross-agent forensics. AIP provides per-agent integrity windows aggregatable for system-level health. |

### 7.1 Governor Agents and the AIP Daimonion

The WEF envisions "dedicated 'governor' or 'auditor' agents" that monitor, audit, or regulate other agents. AIP's daimonion (integrity analysis service) implements this concept at the protocol level:

| WEF Governor Agent Function | AIP Daimonion Implementation |
|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| Monitor agent actions | Integrity Checkpoints analyze every thinking block between turns |
| Validate transactions | Verdicts (`clear`, `review_needed`, `boundary_violation`) per checkpoint |
| Detect anomalies | Six concern categories: `prompt_injection`, `value_misalignment`, `autonomy_violation`, `reasoning_corruption`, `deceptive_reasoning`, `undeclared_intent` |
| Correct unsafe behavior | `recommended_action: "deny_and_escalate"` blocks the agent on critical concerns |
| Scalable oversight | Protocol-level service, not a separate agent — scales with infrastructure |

## 8. Summary Mapping Tables

### 8.1 Classification Dimensions

| WEF Dimension | WEF Agent Card | AAP Alignment Card | Extension |
|---------------|---------------|--------------------|-----------|
| Function | Natural language description | `bounded_actions` + `forbidden_actions` | Machine-parseable, verifiable, includes anti-function |
| Role | Specialist-Generalist scale | `principal.relationship` + action scope | Prescriptive — affects runtime behavior |
| Predictability | Deterministic-Non-deterministic scale | AP-Traces + AIP Checkpoints + drift detection | Observable unpredictability with typed drift directions |
| Autonomy | Low-High scale | Autonomy envelope (actions, triggers, limits) | Decomposed, auditable, enforceable |
| Authority | Low-High scale | Delegation chain + autonomy envelope + expiry | Verifiable delegation chains |
| Use Case | Free-text application domain | `values` (declared, definitions, hierarchy, conflicts) + `extensions` | Evaluable values with consistency verification |
| Environment | Simple-Complex scale | Well-known endpoints + Value Coherence + fail-closed | Zero-trust discoverable, multi-agent compatible |

### 8.2 Pillars and Governance

| WEF Pillar | WEF Recommendation | AAP/AIP Implementation |
|------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Classification | Agent card with 7 dimensions | Alignment Card — JSON schema, well-known endpoint, versioned, expirable |
| Evaluation | Contextualized, multidimensional, temporal, collaborative | AP-Trace verification + AIP integrity checks + drift detection + OTel export |
| Risk Assessment | 5-step lifecycle | Typed violations with severity + concern categories + drift alerts + graduated response |
| Progressive Governance | 9 baseline mechanisms + HITL/HOTL + proportional scaling | Autonomy envelope + `principal.relationship` + AIP monitoring intensity + fail-open/closed |
