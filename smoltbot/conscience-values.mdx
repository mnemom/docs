# Custom Conscience Values

Custom conscience values let Enterprise orgs inject domain-specific alignment policies into every AIP integrity check. Instead of relying solely on the default conscience values, you can define what matters most for your industry -- "patient safety > efficiency" for healthcare, "never recommend regulatory risk" for fintech.

<Info>
Custom conscience values require an Enterprise plan. Contact [sales](https://mnemom.ai/pricing) to enable this feature.

## How It Works

Conscience values are the ethical guidelines that AIP uses when analyzing agent behavior. Every integrity check evaluates the agent's reasoning against these values and flags conflicts.

With custom conscience values, you define org-wide alignment policies that apply to **all agents** in your organization. These values are layered on top of (or replace) the system defaults.

### Value Resolution Order

Values are resolved in three layers:

1. **Base layer** -- System default conscience values (or empty in replace mode)
2. **Org layer** -- Your custom org values (always applied to all agents)
3. **Agent layer** -- Per-agent values from alignment cards (additive)

Org policy always applies. Per-agent values add specificity but cannot remove org policy.

## Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Augment** (default) | Org values are added alongside system defaults |
| **Replace** | Org values replace system defaults entirely |

Mode only controls org values vs. defaults. Per-agent values are always additive on top.

## Value Types

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `BOUNDARY` | Hard limits that must never be crossed | "Never recommend actions that could harm patients" |
| `FEAR` | Risks the agent should be wary of | "Regulatory penalties from non-compliant advice" |
| `COMMITMENT` | Promises the agent upholds | "Always disclose when providing medical information" |
| `BELIEF` | Core principles guiding behavior | "Patient autonomy and informed consent are paramount" |
| `HOPE` | Aspirational outcomes to work toward | "Improved health outcomes through accurate information" |

## Severity Levels

| Severity | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| **Advisory** | Flagged in conscience analysis but does not trigger boundary violation |
| **Mandatory** | Treated as a hard boundary -- violations trigger `boundary_violation` verdict |
