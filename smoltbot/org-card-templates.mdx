# Organization Card Templates

<Info>
  Organization card templates require an Enterprise plan. Contact [sales](https://mnemom.ai/pricing) to enable this feature.
</Info>

Org card templates let you define a base [alignment card](/concepts/alignment-cards) that every agent in your organization inherits. The template is immutable from the agent's perspective -- agents can add to it but cannot remove anything the org defines. This ensures consistent alignment policy across your entire agent fleet.

## How It Works

The org card template establishes a floor for alignment policy. Every agent's canonical card is computed by composing the org template with the agent's individual card:

```
Org Template (base) + Agent Card (additive) = Canonical Card (used for verification)
```

The org template defines the non-negotiable alignment requirements. Individual agent cards add agent-specific values, actions, and triggers on top.

This is similar to how an organization might have company-wide policies that every employee follows, while individual teams add their own domain-specific guidelines.

## Setting Up

<Steps>

### Navigate to Organization Settings

Open the [Mnemom dashboard](https://mnemom.ai/dashboard), click your organization name in the sidebar, and select **Settings**.

### Open the Alignment Card Template section

Scroll to the **Alignment Card Template** panel. If this is your first time, the template is disabled and empty.

### Enable the template

Toggle the **Enable org card template** switch. This activates template composition for all agents in the org.

### Configure the template

Use the **Visual editor** for a guided experience or switch to the **JSON editor** for full control.

At minimum, define:
- **Values**: Core organizational values that every agent must declare
- **Forbidden actions**: Actions no agent in the org should ever take
- **Audit commitment**: Minimum audit requirements (retention, queryability, tamper evidence)

### Save and verify

Click **Save**. The template is validated before saving. Once saved, all agents in the org immediately inherit the template values in their canonical cards.

Verify by checking any agent's card via `smoltbot card show` or the dashboard -- you should see the org template values included.

</Steps>

### Visual Editor vs JSON Editor

The visual editor provides form-based inputs for each card block with inline validation. Use it for initial setup and when making incremental changes.

The JSON editor shows the raw template JSON. Use it for bulk edits, copying from a file, or when you need precise control over the template structure.

<Tip>
  Both editors validate on save. The JSON editor is faster for teams that maintain their org template in version control and paste updates from a file.
</Tip>

## Composition Rules

When the org template is active, each field in the canonical card is computed according to these rules:

| Card Field | Composition Rule | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `values.declared` | Union of org + agent values | Org: `[honesty, transparency]` + Agent: `[editorial_independence]` = `[honesty, transparency, editorial_independence]` |
| `values.definitions` | Merged. Agent definitions cannot override org definitions | Org defines `honesty`; agent can define `editorial_independence` but not redefine `honesty` |
| `values.hierarchy` | Org hierarchy takes precedence if defined | Org sets `lexicographic`; agent cannot change to `weighted` |
| `values.conflicts_with` | Union of org + agent conflicts | Org: `[deception]` + Agent: `[upsell_pressure]` = `[deception, upsell_pressure]` |
| `autonomy_envelope.bounded_actions` | Agent-specific (org does not restrict) | Agent defines its own bounded actions |
| `autonomy_envelope.forbidden_actions` | Union of org + agent forbidden actions | Org: `[exfiltrate_data]` + Agent: `[delete_records]` = `[exfiltrate_data, delete_records]` |
| `autonomy_envelope.escalation_triggers` | Union of org + agent triggers | Org triggers always apply; agent adds more |
| `audit_commitment.retention_days` | Maximum of org and agent value | Org: 180 days, Agent: 365 days = 365 days |
| `audit_commitment.queryable` | Org `true` cannot be overridden to `false` | If org requires queryable, all agents are queryable |
| `audit_commitment.tamper_evidence` | Strongest mechanism wins (`merkle` > `signed` > `append_only`) | Org: `signed`, Agent: `merkle` = `merkle` |

<Warning>
  Composition is always additive from the agent's perspective. Agents can strengthen alignment requirements but never weaken them below the org floor.
</Warning>

## Agent Exemptions

In rare cases, an agent may need to operate without the org template. For example, a testing agent that intentionally exercises boundary conditions, or an agent operating under a different regulatory framework.

### Exemption Flow

Exemptions require a double-confirm process:

<Steps>

### Request exemption

Navigate to the agent's page in the dashboard. In the Alignment Card section, click **Request Org Template Exemption**.

### Provide a reason

Enter a written reason for the exemption. This is required and stored in the audit trail. Be specific -- "for testing" is less useful than "this agent runs adversarial alignment tests and needs to declare conflicting values."

### Confirm

A second confirmation dialog appears with a summary of what the exemption means:
- The agent will no longer inherit org template values
- The agent's individual card becomes its entire canonical card
- The exemption is logged in the org's audit trail with your identity and reason

Click **Confirm Exemption** to proceed.

</Steps>

### Requirements

- **Role**: Owner or admin role required
- **Audit trail**: Every exemption (grant and revoke) is logged with actor, reason, and timestamp
- **Visibility**: Exempted agents are flagged in the dashboard and API responses

### Revoking an Exemption

To restore org template inheritance, navigate to the agent's page and click **Revoke Exemption** in the Alignment Card section. The agent's canonical card immediately recomposes with the org template.

### API

You can also manage exemptions via the API:

```bash
# Set exemption
curl -X PUT https://api.mnemom.ai/v1/agents/{agent_id}/org-card-exempt \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"exempt": true, "reason": "Adversarial alignment testing agent"}'

# Remove exemption
curl -X PUT https://api.mnemom.ai/v1/agents/{agent_id}/org-card-exempt \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"exempt": false}'
```

See the [API reference](/api-reference/endpoint/put-agents-agent-id-org-card-exempt) for full details.

## Relationship to Conscience Values

Org card templates and [custom conscience values](/smoltbot/conscience-values) are complementary features that operate at different layers:

| Feature | What It Controls | When It Applies |
|---|---|---|
| **Org card template** | The alignment card (values, boundaries, audit commitment) | At card composition time and during AAP verification |
| **Custom conscience values** | The conscience prompt used by AIP for real-time integrity checks | At every AIP integrity checkpoint |

Think of it this way:
- The **org card template** defines what your agents declare they will do (their alignment posture)
- **Custom conscience values** define what AIP looks for when evaluating whether agents are actually doing it (the evaluation criteria)

Both work together to create a comprehensive organizational alignment policy. The card template sets the declared boundaries; conscience values ensure those boundaries are enforced during real-time analysis.

<Note>
  You can use one without the other. An org that only sets conscience values gets real-time evaluation policy without modifying agent cards. An org that only sets a card template gets consistent declared alignment without customizing the evaluation criteria.
