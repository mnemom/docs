# Trust infrastructure for AI agents

Mnemom makes AI agent behavior transparent and verifiable. When an agent makes a decision, Mnemom records what it decided, what alternatives it considered, what values it applied, and whether its reasoning was compromised. The result is a verifiable audit trail that any stakeholder can inspect.

Two open-source protocols power this:

- **AAP (Agent Alignment Protocol)** -- Post-hoc verification. Alignment Cards declare an agent's values and boundaries. AP-Traces record every decision. Verification checks whether behavior is consistent with declared intent.
- **AIP (Agent Integrity Protocol)** -- Real-time integrity checking. Analyzes LLM thinking blocks during execution to detect prompt injection, value drift, and manipulation before the agent acts.

<Note>
These are **transparency protocols**, not trust protocols. They make agent behavior observable and auditable -- they do not guarantee trustworthiness. An agent that passes all checks may still behave badly in ways the protocols cannot detect. See the [limitations docs](/protocols/aap/limitations) for what AAP and AIP can and cannot guarantee.

## Get started

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Smoltbot Gateway" icon="bolt" href="/quickstart/smoltbot-gateway">
    **Recommended.** Wrap any LLM API with zero code changes. Full AAP and AIP compliance in minutes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="SDK Direct" icon="code" href="/quickstart/sdk-direct">
    Integrate AAP and AIP directly into your application for maximum control over tracing and verification.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Self-Hosted" icon="server" href="/quickstart/self-hosted">
    Run smoltbot, the API, and the database on your own infrastructure. Full data residency control.

## Key concepts

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Alignment Cards" icon="id-card" href="/concepts/alignment-cards">
    A machine-readable declaration of an agent's values, autonomy boundaries, escalation triggers, and audit commitments. The "constitution" every trace is verified against.
  </Card>
  <Card title="AP-Traces" icon="route" href="/concepts/ap-traces">
    Structured records of agent decisions -- what action was taken, what alternatives were considered, what values were applied, and whether escalation was required.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Integrity Checkpoints" icon="shield-check" href="/concepts/integrity-checkpoints">
    Real-time AIP analysis of LLM thinking blocks. Each checkpoint produces a verdict: `clear`, `review_needed`, or `boundary_violation`.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Drift Detection" icon="chart-line" href="/concepts/drift-detection">
    Statistical monitoring of agent behavior over time. Detects when an agent's actions gradually diverge from its declared alignment.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Value Coherence" icon="handshake" href="/concepts/value-coherence">
    Pairwise compatibility checking between agents. Before two agents collaborate, coherence checks verify their values are not in conflict.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## SDK packages

Install the protocol SDKs directly if you need fine-grained control:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @mnemom/agent-alignment-protocol
npm install @mnemom/agent-integrity-protocol
```

```bash pip
pip install agent-alignment-proto
pip install agent-integrity-proto
```
</CodeGroup>

| Package | Language | Registry | Description |
|---------|----------|----------|-------------|
| `@mnemom/agent-alignment-protocol` | TypeScript | npm | AAP verification, coherence, drift detection |
| `@mnemom/agent-integrity-protocol` | TypeScript | npm | AIP integrity checking, signal building |
| `agent-alignment-proto` | Python | PyPI | AAP verification, coherence, drift detection |
| `agent-integrity-proto` | Python | PyPI | AIP integrity checking, signal building |
