# Pick your path

There are three ways to add alignment verification and integrity checking to your AI agents. Choose the one that fits your constraints.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Smoltbot Gateway" icon="bolt" href="/quickstart/smoltbot-gateway">
    **Recommended.** Wrap any LLM API. Zero code changes. Full AAP + AIP compliance in minutes. Works with Anthropic, OpenAI, and Gemini.
  </Card>
  <Card title="SDK Direct" icon="code" href="/quickstart/sdk-direct">
    Integrate AAP and AIP directly into your application code. Define alignment cards, generate traces, run integrity checks, and verify coherence with full programmatic control.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Self-Hosted" icon="server" href="/quickstart/self-hosted">
    Run smoltbot, the API, and the database on your own infrastructure. Complete data residency. Cloudflare Workers + Supabase stack.
  </Card>

## Comparison

| Feature | Gateway | SDK Direct | Self-Hosted |
|---------|---------|------------|-------------|
| **Setup time** | 5 minutes | 30 minutes | 2 hours |
| **Code changes** | None | Moderate | Moderate |
| **AAP traces** | Automatic | Manual | Automatic |
| **AIP integrity** | Automatic | Manual | Automatic |
| **Dashboard** | Included | Included | Self-hosted |
| **Data residency** | Mnemom cloud | Mnemom cloud | Your infrastructure |
| **Enforcement modes** | observe / nudge / enforce | You implement | observe / nudge / enforce |
| **Multi-provider** | Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini | Any (you extract thinking) | Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini |
| **Cost** | Usage-based | Usage-based | Free (you pay infra costs) |

## Which should I choose?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I want the fastest path to compliance">
    Use the **Smoltbot Gateway**. Install the CLI, run `smoltbot init`, and your existing LLM API calls are automatically traced and verified. No code changes required.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I need full control over tracing and verification">
    Use **SDK Direct**. You define exactly when traces are generated, how integrity checks run, and what happens on violations. Best for custom agent frameworks or when you need to integrate with existing observability systems.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="My data cannot leave my infrastructure">
    Use **Self-Hosted**. Deploy the smoltbot stack (Cloudflare Workers + Supabase) on your own accounts. All data stays in your infrastructure. Same automatic tracing as the gateway, but you control everything.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I'm building an agent-to-agent system">
    Start with **SDK Direct** for value coherence checking between agents. You can combine this with the gateway for tracing, or handle traces yourself. See the [A2A integration guide](/protocols/aap/a2a-integration) for details.
