The Teams API provides programmatic access to team management, team alignment cards, team reputation scores, and embeddable team badges. Teams are first-class meta-agents with persistent identity and accumulated reputation.

## SDK Usage

### TypeScript

```typescript
import { createTeam, getTeam, addMembers, deriveTeamCard } from '@mnemom/teams';
import { fetchTeamReputation } from '@mnemom/reputation';

// Create a team
const { team, members } = await createTeam({
  org_id: 'org-abc123',
  name: 'Pipeline Alpha',
  agent_ids: ['agent-a', 'agent-b', 'agent-c'],
});

// Add more members
await addMembers(team.id, ['agent-d']);

// Derive alignment card from member cards
const { derived_card } = await deriveTeamCard(team.id);

// Check team reputation
const reputation = await fetchTeamReputation(team.id);
if (reputation?.is_eligible) {
  console.log(`Team score: ${reputation.score} (${reputation.grade})`);
}
```

### Python

```python
import httpx

API_BASE = "https://api.mnemom.ai"
HEADERS = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}", "Content-Type": "application/json"}

# Create a team
team = httpx.post(f"{API_BASE}/v1/teams", headers=HEADERS, json={
    "org_id": "org-abc123",
    "name": "Pipeline Alpha",
    "agent_ids": ["agent-a", "agent-b", "agent-c"],
}).json()

team_id = team["team"]["id"]

# Derive card
httpx.post(f"{API_BASE}/v1/teams/{team_id}/card/derive", headers=HEADERS)

# Check reputation (public, no auth)
reputation = httpx.get(f"{API_BASE}/v1/teams/{team_id}/reputation").json()
print(f"Score: {reputation['score']}, Grade: {reputation['grade']}")
```
