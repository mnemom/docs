## Base URL

All API requests are made to:

```
https://api.mnemom.ai/v1
```

The API is versioned via URL path. The current version is `v1`.

## Authentication

The Mnemom API supports two authentication methods depending on your use case.

### Bearer Token (Supabase JWT)

For dashboard and user-facing requests, authenticate with a Supabase JWT:

```bash
curl https://api.mnemom.ai/v1/agents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

**How to get a Bearer token**: Sign in to the [Mnemom Dashboard](https://mnemom.ai/dashboard). Your session token is available in the dashboard settings under **API Access**, or programmatically via the Supabase Auth SDK after signing in.

### API Key

For server-to-server integrations, authenticate with an API key:

```bash
curl https://api.mnemom.ai/v1/checks \
  -H "X-Mnemom-Api-Key: <key>"
```

**How to get an API key**: Generate an API key from the [Mnemom Dashboard](https://mnemom.ai/dashboard) under **Settings > API Keys**. API keys are scoped to your organization and can be rotated at any time.

<Warning>
API keys are hashed on our servers and cannot be retrieved after creation. Store your key securely when it is first displayed.
</Warning>

## Error Format

All error responses return a JSON body with a human-readable `error` field:

```json
{
  "error": "Human-readable error message"
}
```

### Common HTTP Status Codes

| Status Code | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| `400` | **Bad Request** — The request body is malformed or missing required fields. |
| `401` | **Unauthorized** — Missing or invalid authentication credentials. |
| `403` | **Forbidden** — Valid credentials but insufficient permissions for the requested resource. |
| `404` | **Not Found** — The requested resource does not exist. |
| `429` | **Too Many Requests** — Rate limit exceeded. Retry after the duration specified in the `Retry-After` header. |
| `500` | **Internal Server Error** — Something went wrong on our end. Contact support if the issue persists. |

## Rate Limits

API requests are rate-limited per authentication credential:

| Plan | Rate Limit |
|------|------------|
| Free | 10 requests/second |
| Developer | 50 requests/second |
| Team | 200 requests/second |
| Enterprise | Custom |

When you exceed the rate limit, the API returns a `429` status code with a `Retry-After` header indicating how many seconds to wait before retrying.

## Endpoint Documentation

<Note>
All endpoint documentation below is auto-generated from our OpenAPI specification. Each endpoint has a "Try It" button for interactive testing.
</Note>

## Versioning

The API is versioned via the URL path (`/v1`). When breaking changes are introduced, a new version will be released under a new path (e.g., `/v2`). Non-breaking changes (new optional fields, new endpoints) are added to the current version without a version bump.

We will provide advance notice and a migration guide before deprecating any API version.
